name: wireframe-tool-scout
description: Survey the AI wireframing and low-fidelity design tools that exist right now, say what each does well and how mature it is, and stamp the answer with a date, since this category moves faster than any printed recommendation survives. Use when someone is choosing a wireframing or design tool, asks whether AI design tools are usable yet, or wants to know what their organization might already have.

# SKILL: AI Wireframing Tool Scout

**From:** Index Card Design Worksheet

## When to load this skill

Load this skill when the reader is about to design screens and wants to know what tooling is
worth using. Also load it when they have heard about an AI design tool and want a straight
answer about whether it is ready.

## Why this is a skill and not a recommendation

The book takes a deliberate position here: as of its writing, the author researched the
commercially available AI wireframing tools and found the options so new that none worked well
enough to recommend one. Rather than print a recommendation with a short shelf life, the reader
is pointed at their own organization.

This skill is the live version of that check. It runs the survey on the day it is asked, and it
says how fresh the answer is.

## Two questions to ask before surveying anything

**What does the organization already have?** Tools already approved and paid for beat better
tools the reader cannot use. This is also where the AI tool decision checklist applies: an
unavailable tool may mean nobody asked, or may mean security said no.

**Do they need a tool at all?** The book raises this directly. An engineer with reusable design
components from other applications may get there just as fast without adding anything. Ask how
often they design genuinely new applications. Investing in a tool pays off for someone starting
screens regularly, and not for someone doing it twice a year.

Answer these before producing a survey. Frequently the survey is unnecessary.

## What this skill produces

For each tool:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| **What it does** | In one sentence |
| **Where it fits** | Sketch, wireframe, high-fidelity mockup, or prototype |
| **Maturity** | How long it has existed, how stable, whether it is still changing weekly |
| **What it does well** | Specifically, not generally |
| **What it does badly** | Reported problems, not marketing gaps |
| **Cost and access** | Free tier, paid tier, what it wants connected |
| **Output** | What comes out, and whether it can be edited afterward in a normal design tool |

That last row decides more than it appears to. A tool producing something nobody can edit has
handed the reader a picture rather than a design.

Then:

- **How current this is.** State the date and say plainly that this category turns over fast.
- **What the category still cannot do.** Where every tool is weak is more useful than a ranking.
- **What to check before committing,** especially anything that wants access to existing design
  files or a component library.

## Prompt the reader can run directly

> You are a research assistant. I am [DESCRIBE THE APPLICATION] and I need to produce
> [SKETCHES / WIREFRAMES / MOCKUPS]. I design new applications about [HOW OFTEN].
>
> First, tell me whether I need a dedicated tool at all, given how often I do this and that I
> may already have reusable components.
>
> Then survey the AI wireframing and low-fidelity design tools that currently exist. For each,
> tell me what it does, which design stage it covers, how mature it is, what it does well and
> badly according to users rather than marketing, what it costs, and whether its output can be
> edited afterward in a normal design tool.
>
> Tell me today's date and how quickly this category changes.
>
> Finally, tell me what none of these tools do well yet.

## What to tell the reader

- **Check your organization first.** An approved tool you can use today beats a better one you
  cannot.
- **Reusable components may be enough.** The fastest path to a wireframe is often the one
  already sitting in the last project.
- **Judge output by editability.** A design nobody can change is a dead end at the first round
  of feedback.
- **This answer expires.** Run it again next time rather than trusting these notes.

## What this skill does not do

It does not produce wireframes, endorse a product, or know what the reader's organization has
approved. It surveys the field and dates the survey. For the design work itself, the
design-round-exploration skill is the one to load.
