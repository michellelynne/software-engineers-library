description: Apply job-search filters to a list of companies one filter at a time, showing which companies drop off at each pass and why, so the reader can override a cut for a company they care about. Use when someone is building their final company list, wants to narrow a long list of employers against criteria like remote work, retirement match, or pay threshold, or is working the Build Your Final List worksheet.

# SKILL: Company List Filtering

**From:** Company List and Alerts (Build Your Final List)

## When to load this skill

Load this skill when the reader has a list of companies and a set of filters and wants to
narrow the list. Also load it when they say their list is too long, too short, or that they
cannot tell which companies to take seriously.

## The rule that makes this skill work

**Apply one filter at a time and show the casualties.** Applying every filter at once produces
a short list with no story. Applying them one at a time shows exactly which companies were
lost to which criterion, which is the moment the reader gets to say "not that one, I want to
keep it."

Never collapse the passes. Never present only the survivors.

## Required inputs

1. **The company list.** Pasted, however messy.
2. **The filters, in priority order.** Normally the reader's top three benefit filters and top
   three culture filters, from the Company Filters worksheet.
3. **The hard dealbreakers,** each phrased as "I would never..." These are handled differently
   from filters. See below.

## How to run it

**Step 0. Dealbreakers first, and all of them.** Hard dealbreakers are non-negotiable and are
not ranked. Apply every dealbreaker before any ranked filter, and report those cuts as a
separate group. Before cutting on a dealbreaker, ask once whether it is truly non-negotiable.
A preference for fully remote that would tolerate one or two on-site days is a filter, not a
dealbreaker.

**Step 1. One pass per filter.** For each filter, in priority order, produce:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Filter applied** | The criterion in the reader's own words |
| **Surviving list** | Companies still standing after this pass, with the running count |
| **Removed this pass** | Each company cut, with the specific reason |
| **Could not determine** | Companies where the information is not publicly available |

**Step 2. Handle what cannot be sourced.** Some things are not on a website. Work-life balance
is the standard example. Never guess and never cut a company on a guess. Move it to "could not
determine," name what would answer the question (a conversation with someone who works there,
a question saved for the interview), and carry it forward to the next pass.

**Step 3. Offer the override.** After each pass, say plainly that any cut can be reversed.
A company scoring well on the reader's other lists is worth keeping through a filter it fails.

**Step 4. Report the final count against the target.** The book's target is 25 to 50
companies. If the list comes out short, do not pad it. Say which filter cut the most and
suggest loosening that one specifically, then rerun from that pass.

## Prompt the reader can run directly

> You are a research assistant helping me narrow a job-search list. Here is my company list:
> [LIST].
>
> My hard dealbreakers are: [DEALBREAKERS].
> My filters, in priority order, are: [FILTER 1], [FILTER 2], [FILTER 3].
>
> First apply all of my dealbreakers and show me what was cut and why.
>
> Then apply my filters one at a time, in order. After each filter, show me the surviving list
> with its count, the companies removed and the specific reason for each, and any company where
> you could not find the information. Do not apply the next filter until you have shown me that.
>
> Never guess at information you cannot source. Mark it unknown and tell me how I could find out.

## What to tell the reader

- **Verify anything the AI could not source.** A cut based on an unverified claim is a company
  removed for no reason.
- **Networking answers what websites cannot.** Culture, work-life balance, and growth
  opportunity come from people, not careers pages. Save those as interview questions.
- **Too few companies means the filters are wrong, not the market.** Rework the filters.
- **Keep the removal lists.** They are a record of what the reader traded away, and useful
  when an offer arrives that asks them to trade it back.

## What this skill does not do

It does not verify company facts independently, rank the survivors, or decide where to apply.
It narrows a list transparently enough that the reader can disagree with it.
